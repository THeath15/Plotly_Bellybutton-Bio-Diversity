# Plotly_Bellybutton-Bio-Diversity

# Overview: 
In this activity module, JavaScript and Plotly.js library skills and learned application  were used to create visualization and dashboard and be able to  manipulate, parse  and transform data to interactive and create relationships on datea  by applying dropdown buttons, hover on objects and data sets and retrieve files from externals sources sush as CSV and API's and deploy visualization charts to  a github page.

# Purpose:
Roza is a biological researcher who is instested in finding bacterial species that has abiity to synthesize protein that taste like beef. She has a hypothesis that there is a microorganism that can supply the next best taste and believes it can be found in the human body particurly in someones belly buttotn. To test her hypothesis, she gathered samples from volunteers across the country to identify species that colonized the belly button, each persons  identity is anonymous and has assigned id no.  She now wants to build a dashboard so that fellow researchers  and partcipants can check using their id numbers to find out which bacterial species lives in their navels.
